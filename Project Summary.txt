Project Summary :

- Characterisation of ties in research community

Phase 1 : Data Collection

1. We got an Data-set available online (Citation dataset having information regarding papers and citations among them) having attributes  : 
	Paper- Id
	Paper-Title
	Authors
	Publication venue
	year
	references Abstract

Site link : https://aminer.org/citation (Version 10)

2. We have manually collected list of faculties ( Computer Science and IT) of Top universities in India as well US (approx 1024 
faculties name from each country)



Phase 2 : Data Pre-processing

1. We had filtered Data-set available online according to our requirements i.e

	We filtered only those papers data( which was available online) which were authored by faculties we have collected seperately for India 
as well as US.



Phase 3 : Data Storage

1. Since the Data available online was in JSON format it was easy to upload on Mongodb ( made different db and collection for India and US)



Phase 4 : Data Analysis

Graph 1 : No. Of papers per authors
Graph 2 : average no. Of references per author
Graph 3 : average no. Of co-authors per author
Graph 4 : node degree distribution based on references without weight ( if referred count only 1 otherwise 0)
Graph 5 : node degree distribution based on references with weight ( count no. Of times referred)


Phase 5 : Future Work

Ques. 
a. Node degree distribution based on co-authors without weight ( i.e If co-authored together count as 1 otherwise 0)
b. Node degree distribution based on co-authors with weight  ( counting no. of times co-authored together)

Ques. Most influential Researcher based on :
a. no. of papers
b. No. of citations

Ques. Most influential researchers Temporally ( Using year attribute of Data-set).

Result enhancement :
